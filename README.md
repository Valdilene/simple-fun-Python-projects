# simple-fun-Python-projects
Here are a few simple Python projects I used to practice my programming skills while also having fun and creating something interesting:

1 - Guess the Number: Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. The program should tell the user whether their guess is too high or too low, and keep track of the number of guesses they've made.

2 - Rock, Paper, Scissors: Write a program that plays the game of rock, paper, scissors with the user. The program should ask the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors, generate a random choice for the computer, and determine the winner.

3 - Calculator: Write a program that takes two numbers and performs a basic arithmetic operation (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on them.

4 - Mad Libs: Write a program that prompts the user to enter several words (such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives) and then inserts them into a pre-written story to create a funny or silly result.

5 - Hangman: Write a program that selects a random word from a list and asks the user to guess letters in the word. The program should keep track of the user's guesses and display a hangman image as the user makes incorrect guesses.
